BitByBit is proud to be developed on great technologies. We appreciate the opportunity that Blockly, BabylonJS and VerbNurbs
provide.
<h3>The BitByBit Core Platform</h3>
<p>BitByBit is a geometric programming platform for innovators. Programming language that was implemented in BitByBit platform
    consists of basic building blocks that can compose various 3D shapes. Starting from simple points, lines and going
    into NURBS curves and surfaces. This model allows creators to learn by experimenting. 3D environment
    that is integrated in the platform provides instant feedback and gratification, which inspires users to grow and
    innovate.
</p>
<h3>Principles</h3>
<p>BitByBit will always keep it's Core free for its users. Principles of minimalism and simplicity are reflected in all of
    the design decisions we make. Application itself is frictionless, users don't need to create accounts or install
    browser plugins. BitByBit creators have no intention of tracking the users by any analytical tools that can cause
    performance issues or be blocked by various browser addons. We could not find a better Home screen for the
    application than the application itself. Website immediately starts the empty canvas for your code and an empty 3D
    world. All Core algorithms will always remain opensource and will not require any backend based server
    infrastructure. This will allow application to be used on various devices as a Progressive Web App (PWA). After the application is loaded on your devices, internet
    connectivitiy will not be required for it to function.
</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>While BitByBit Core will remain frictionless, community members are encouraged to create Forum accounts, share their
creations, ask questions, teach, inspire each other and grow.
