# bitbybit
Platform for programming geometry on the browser

# about
BitByBit is a geometric programming platform for innovators. Programming language that was implemented in BitByBit platform consists of basic building blocks that can compose various 3D shapes. Starting from simple points, lines and going into full fledged NURBS curves and surfaces. This model allows creators to learn by experimenting. 3D environment that is integrated in the platform provides instant feedback and gratification, which inspires users to grow and innovate.

# principles
BitByBit will always keep it's Core free and opensource for its users. Principles of minimalism and simplicity are reflected in all of the design decisions we make. Application itself is frictionless, users don't need to create accounts or install browser plugins. BitByBit creators have no intention of tracking the users by any analytical tools that can cause performance issues or be blocked by various browser addons. We could not find a better Home screen for the application than the application itself. Website immediately starts the empty canvas for your code and an empty 3D world. All Core algorithms will always remain opensource and will not require any backend based server  infrastructure. This will allow application to be used on various devices as a Progressive Web App (PWA). After the application is loaded on your devices, internet connectivitiy will not be required for it to function.
