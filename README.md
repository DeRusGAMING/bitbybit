Bit by bit developers core library
This project contains core 3D algorithms of Bit by bit developers platform which are open-sourced under MIT license. This library was previously UI dependant and is now separated to ensure protection of our corporate identity and cloud services. Currently it is still dependant on Angular, but this will change in the future and we will be providing example app that will show you how this code could be integrated in your own projects.

Build package:
tsc -p tsconfig.bitbybit.json

Principles
Bit by bit developers company will keep these core algorithms that you can find in this repository free and opensource for its users. These algorithms are based on other open-source projects, run and are deployed on the browser, thus there is no point of closing them down from public.

About Bit by bit developers platform
Bit by bit developers web platform allows creators to program geometry through simple visual programming language or choose monaco typescript editor with full intellisense of bitbybit API. This cloud platform can fulfil many practical, educational and artistic needs of its users. Through familiar programming interface used in tools such as Scratch and Blockly.Games we expose powerful 3D algorithms that make it easier to implement various parametric tasks. Our goal is to make it very simple for users to share their ideas and designs. We want to encourage everyone to engage in the future of this tool.

Major Dependencies
